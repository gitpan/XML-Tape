Hi,

This is the XML::Tape module. It is a class to manipulate
XMLtape archives. These archives are well suited to store
many XML documents. XMLtapes can be easy transported and 
parsed and validated with off-the-shelf XML tools. A 
description of XMLtape in digital libraries is found in
this publication:

’File-based storage of Digital Objects and constituent 
datastreams: XMLtapes and Internet Archive ARC files’
 http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.DL/0503016

To install the module:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install
